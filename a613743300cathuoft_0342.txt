“ 30. Passing over other similar decisione, we may refer 10
1116 0686 of the Armenian Bishops of the ecclesiastical province
of Constantinople, wh0, at a conference held in 1853, had
enumerated among the means of converting the schismatics of
their nation the allowing their children 10 attend Catholic
schools. The General Congregation of Propaganda thereupon
gave orders for a letter to be written 10 1116 Archbishop and
Primate, saying that the proposed means was recognised as well
adapted to effect the conversion of the schismatics3 but that
great prudence was necessary to prevent any evil consequences.
For, in the first place, the Catholic children might be in danger
of perversion, if they were allowed to hold long conversations
with the schismatical pupils3 inasmuch as there would‘be found
among the schismatics shrewd and talented youthS, wh0, by
their training at home, had become deeply rooted in schism3
and among the Catholics there would 116 801116 of poor 6111111168,

10 ward off the dangers above mentioned, in schools where
Catholics and schismatics 616 mixed together, the Bishops of

the province were advised 10 draw up in their next provincial ⁷

council suitable regulations for these mixed schools, subject 10
1116 approbation of this Sacred Congregation.

3. We have lastly to speak of the admission of schismatics
and Protestants into Catholic boarding-schools and collegeS.
It would be impossible 10 lay down a sure and adequate rule,
applicable to every such house of education, without special ’
and accurate knowledge of all the circumstances affecting them.
Hence it would be necessary to know precisely the object of the
institution, the social position and age of its pupils, the kind ·.
and extent of the education there given, and its rules of internal
