APPEND. xv. 3:23

preserving Catholic children from all danger of perversi0n‚ and
non-Catholics from the danger of indifferent-e to religion. Some
of the resolutions passed in this matter by the S. Congregation
may here be mentioned.

10. At a special meeting, held December 18, 1742, it was
decided that the Capuchin missionaries of Moscow, in addition
to the instruction in foreign languages and secular sciences
which they gave to the children of CatholicS, might, in a sepa-
rate room, give the same instruction to such non-Catholics as

desired it. The use of a separate room entirely or almost
removes the dangers above described, arising from the inter-

course of Catholics and non-CathOIiCS, in which the chief
difficulty of the Mixed Schools consists 3 if indeed schools 0011
strictly be called mioeed, in which a distinct and separate place is
assigned to the non-Catholic pupils. But for want of space or
of meanS, 01 through a scarcity of teachers in missionary coun-
trieS‚ this separate system could not, without the greatest
difficulty, be everywhere introduced.

20. Towards the end of the last century, the Reformed
Missionary Fathers in Upper Egypt had opened Schools for
Catholics in several stations of that Mission, which were also
attended by the children of the Coptic schismatics. The
General Congregation, held August 29, 1791, was of opinion
that this might be tolerated, in order to dispose the Co'ptic
heretics to Catholicity, and to avoid giving them offence3 but
it added, ‘periculum perversionis per magistrorum diligentiam
removeatur.' In conformity with this resolution of the Sacred
congregation, the prefect of the aforesaid Mission was informed
that there need not be any difficulty in allowing the children of
heretics to go to the Catholic schools3 that, on the contrary,
much good might be expected from their attendance, inasmuch
as they might thus become acquainted with the solid principles
of our true religion, and the influence of the teachers might
gain them over to the Church3 but· that, lest any one of the
Catholic children should be perverted, the teachers must take
0010 10 exclude from the schools all heretical children of an
immoral character.
