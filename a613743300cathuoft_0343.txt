APPEND. xv. 325

discipline, especially with ‘regard to the intercourse permitted
either in boys' or in girls' schOOIS, between pupils of different
religionst such as whether they may freely associate and spcak
with one another, or are fordidden to speak upon oeligious
topics. It would also be necessary to know how the non-
Catholics are directed in religious matters: namely‚ whether
they are educated in the Catholic religion, with, or with-
out, the consent of their parents; and, if they are not so
educated, whether they are permitted, or even obliged, to be
present, together with the Catholics, at Holy Mass and other
practices of piety3 whether they have always to abstain from
receiving their own sacramentS, or are allowed sometimes to
receive them in their schismatica] churcheS, and, if so, who
goes with them. Again, it would be important to know the
number of Protestants and schismatics in each institution,
and in what proportion they are to the Catholics.

It would be necessary, therefore, that the superiors of the
several Missions should obtain, if possible, the information
above referred tc, respecting the mixed boarding-schools (or
colleges) under their jurisdiction 3 and should send it to the S.
Congregation, so as to be furnished in reply with instructions
suitable to the peculiar circumstances of each case. In the
meantime, however, it will be useful to make known a decision
which the Holy Office has recently given in the case of a mixed
boarding-school, of Catholic girls of the Latin Rite and schis-
matics of the Oriental Rite. But it will be well, before
quoting it, to give some idea of the internal regulations of the
school, in order that the decision may be better understood.

The establishment is under the direction of nunS, for the
education of Catholic girIS, together with schismatics of the
Oriental Rite. The proportion between them has not always
been the same. For the last five years the schismatics have
formed about a third part of the school. They are instructed‚
not only in secular subjectS, but also in the Catholic religion if
their parents expressly desire it. Besides receiving Catholic
instruction, the schismatical pupils have spiritual reading,
make spiritual retreatS, and are present daily at holy Mass,
